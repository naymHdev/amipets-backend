-+1. Shelters Dashboard – Missing Management and Tracking Features

	+1.1 Map pin behavior - DONE

	-1.2 File attachments

	Uploaded files are visible, but users still cannot download them.
	Adding a new file removes the previously uploaded files completely.
	This results in data loss, which is a critical issue.


	-1.3 Adopted pets chart

	Please propose a concrete solution.
	Currently the chart is non-functional, and shelters cannot track monthly adoption statistics.
	We need stable logic for consistent data, even if pet statuses change multiple times.

	Here are two logic ideas for fixing the donated pets chart, if you are able to implement them:


		1. Preferred logic (ideal solution):

	When a pet’s status changes away from “Adopted”, it should disappear from the chart.

	When the status is changed back to “Adopted”, the pet should appear again in the chart based on the newest “Adopted” timestamp.

	This means the chart always reflects the real current situation.


		2. Alternative (simpler) logic, if the first option is not possible:

	Use the first time the pet was assigned the status “Adopted” as the date for the chart.

	Ignore any later status changes for this specific pet.


	-1.4 Notifications

	Admin dashboard should receive notifications when:
	• A new user profile is created
	• A new shelter profile is created

	Shelters should receive notifications when:
	• A new adoption request is submitted for their stray pet

-+2. Services – Ability to Set Service Order in Dashboard

Done with categories. Have to be done with services. Our last chats about it:


"I would suggest the following approach in the admin dashboard:

Each service has a field for a number.

If the number is 1, it always appears in the 1st place; if 2 – in the 2nd place, and so on.

If the number is 0, the service is shown in a random position each time, while excluding the already fixed ones.

This way, only the highlighted services have fixed positions, while all others remain randomized."


"Here’s how we’d like it to work:

Fixed-position services should always appear at the beginning of the list (not at the end).

Services without fixed positions should appear in random order each time the page is refreshed or reloaded — their placement should not remain static.

Normally, there shouldn’t be any “gaps” between fixed services. However, if gaps do occur — for example, when positions 2 and 4 are fixed — there are two possible approaches:

The system automatically fills the in-between positions with random services each time, or

The system only allows assigning fixed positions in sequence (so position 2 can’t be fixed before position 1 is set, and so on).

Either option is fine — whichever is technically simpler and ensures a consistent layout on the front end."

-14. Take Me Home Page – Required Fields Not Enforced

On the Take Me Home page, required fields in forms are not functioning correctly - all fields are treated as optional. And there are no signs which question is optional and which one is required.

Expected Behavior:
Required fields should be properly enforced, preventing form submission until they are filled out.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-+15. Explore Page – Filtering Function Issues

Problems:

	+15.1 Done

	15.2 When multiple filters are selected, the system still returns no results, even when valid matching pets exist.
Example: choosing Cat shows results, choosing Female shows results, but selecting Cat + Female returns none, although such pets exist.

	+15.3 DONE

	-15.4 After applying filters, the Explore page layout still breaks.
The search bar, filter icon, and bottom bar disappear instead of keeping the standard Explore page UI.

	15.5 In the Lithuanian version, even single filters do not return correct results.
For example, selecting only pet type or only gender already gives incorrect/empty results.


Even though some parts are already fixed (15.1 and 15.3), the filtering system is still unstable both in the English and Lithuanian versions.

At the moment, filters behave inconsistently. For example, sometimes selecting “Cat” returns results, and other times the same filter returns none. The same happens with gender or combined filters. Even without any filters applied, the Explore page randomly shows a different total number of pets (sometimes 6, then 8, then 7), which should not happen.

In short, the filtering logic still breaks somewhere — results appear and disappear unpredictably.

So it seems that filters are still not working reliably and something in the system is still failing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-+16. Favorites – Filter Function Should Work Like Search

There are still issues with the Favorites filtering function, something is still breaking in the system.

For example:

-In the Explore page it doesn’t show that a pet is marked as Favorite.

-But when filtering by Favorites, that pet does appear.

-Inside the pet profile it also shows as favorited.

-But in the main Explore list, the pet is missing.



(Just giving ideas, because now I don't understand where and why system fails.

It looks like the Explore page keeps reloading differently each time, because pets appear and disappear randomly, even when no filters are used. The total number of pets also changes (one time 6, another time 8, another time 7), even though no filters are applied.

This might be the reason why the system breaks — the Explore page seems to constantly rebuild itself in a different order.

Maybe the order of homeless pets should change only once per app launch, not constantly every time the Explore page reloads, because now we can't see all homeless pets, maybe you have other idea how to fix it.)



There’s also still an issue with profiles mixing:

In one account I remove all favorites — the list is empty.

I log into another account and mark a pet as favorite.

When I return to the first (Google) account, Explore shows the Favorite icon on that same pet, but filtering doesn’t return any results.

So Favorites and Explore are still not loading consistently, and data between accounts is getting mixed.

+18. My Pets – No Option to Delete Pet Profile - DONE

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-19. Services – Location Filtering Should Be Specific by Service Type

Currently, location filtering for services pulls cities from all service types together, showing a combined filter result for everyone.

Expected Behavior:
Each service type should have its own city list:

Stores: only cities where stores are located

Veterinary: only cities where vet services are available

Training, etc.: only their relevant cities
Filtering should display results specific to the selected service type, not a combined list.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-20. Services – Search Bar and Dashboard Keywords

If possible it would be very useful to have a search bar in the services list. In the dashboard, each service should have a field to enter keywords. These keywords would not be visible in the app but would be used by the search bar.

Expected Behavior:

Services list has a search bar in the app.

Dashboard allows adding keywords per service (hidden in the app).

Search bar filters services based on name, description, and dashboard keywords.

Just a question, can we translate results for Lithuanian version? (Chipped - "Čipuotas"; Not chipped "Nečipuotas")

-26. Explore Page – Missing Pets

Problem:
On the Explore page, some pets are not displayed at all. For example, there are 11 total pets uploaded, but only 10 appear on the page. The random ordering works correctly, as the pets change position after each reload, but profiles are missing from the list.

Expected Behavior:
All uploaded pet profiles should be shown, each exactly once. The random order functionality should remain, but without skipping any pets.

+27. Home Page “See All” → Explore Page – Duplicated / Inflated Stray Animals List - DONE

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-28. Google Login – Profile Picture Disappears After Each Login

Problem:
When logging in using Google, the user’s profile picture disappears after each new login session. The image needs to be re-uploaded manually every time, which causes inconvenience and inconsistency in user profiles.

Expected Behavior:
Once a user logs in with Google, their profile picture should remain saved and consistently displayed across all sessions, without needing to re-upload it after each login.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-29. NEW

While testing the app, we noticed that now in every screen, the bottom part of the content is hidden behind the bottom bar.
