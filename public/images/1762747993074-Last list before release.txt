1. Shelters Dashboard – Missing Management and Tracking Features

Shelters have started reporting that the current dashboard is inconvenient to use. There is no option to mark an animal as adopted, deceased, in quarantine, or reserved, and no way to view related statistics.

The dashboard should allow shelters to easily update an animal’s status (adopted, deceased, in quarantine, reserved) and view separate lists for each category. Only pets currently available for adoption should be visible in the app.

(At the same time, while we’ve been focused on fixing bugs and still haven’t managed to properly launch the app, new competitor have already appeared on the market. Their shelter dashboards are far more advanced — shelters can record medical notes, attach files, write internal comments, track all animal statuses, and even generate and print adoption contracts directly from the dashboard.)

Because of these missing features and ongoing issues, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to attract shelters to use our platform.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Services – Ability to Set Service Order in Dashboard

Currently, there is no way to control the order in which services (e.g., training, stores, vet) are displayed in the app.

Expected Behavior:
The dashboard should allow setting the display order of services so that the app shows them in the desired sequence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Login Page – Back Button Not Working

There is a “Back” button at the top of the login screen, but pressing it does nothing. It doesn’t perform any action or navigation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Login with Password – “Stay Logged In” Option

Currently, the “Stay Logged In” checkbox behaves as mandatory — users cannot proceed with login unless it’s selected.

Expected Behavior:
The checkbox should be optional, allowing users to log in whether it’s checked or not. Alternatively, if it’s not necessary, the checkbox and its label should be removed entirely.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Login Screen – “Don’t have an account? Sign up” Text Alignment

On the login screen, the text “Don’t have an account? Sign up” at the bottom is not centered properly and appears misaligned.

Expected Behavior:
The text should be horizontally centered at the bottom of the screen for consistent visual alignment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Registration Screen – “Already have an account? Log in” Text Alignment

On the registration screen, the text “Already have an account? Log in” is not horizontally centered and appears slightly off alignment.

Expected Behavior:
The text should be perfectly centered horizontally at the bottom of the screen for a clean and balanced layout.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Home Page – Location Dropdown Not Functioning

At the top of the home page, there is a displayed location with a dropdown arrow, but tapping it does nothing. Previously, the frontend included a working modal for selecting or detecting a location via GPS, but now the location can only be manually entered, and the GPS-based location detection feature is missing.

Expected Behavior:
Tapping the location dropdown should open a selection window that allows users to either detect their current location via GPS or manually select a location.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Bottom Bar – Extra White Bar Above

At the bottom of all pages, the bottom bar displays an extra white/grey bar above it. It looks “stuck” to the top of the bottom bar, but it should not be there.

Expected Behavior:
The bottom bar should appear clean with no extra white/grey bar above.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. Notifications – Remove “Successful Login” Messages

In the notifications list, messages like “Hello, you have successfully logged in” with the login date are displayed. These messages are unnecessary and clutter the notifications feed.

Expected Behavior:
Such automatic login confirmation messages should not appear in the notifications list. Only meaningful notifications relevant to the user should be displayed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10. Home Page – Stray Animal Cards Not Interactive

Stray animal cards on the home page are not interactive - tapping them does nothing.

Expected Behavior:
Tapping a stray animal card should open that animal’s profile page.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11. Home & Explore Pages – Pets Cards Extra White Space

On the Home and Explore pages, pet cards have a large empty white space below them, which is visually unnecessary.

Expected Behavior:
The extra white space below pet cards should be removed so the cards display more compactly and look visually consistent.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

12. Animal Profile – Description Text Not Selectable

On an animal’s profile, the description text cannot be selected or copied.

Expected Behavior:
Users should be able to select and copy any part of the description text, e.g., for donation purposes or sharing information.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

13. Pet Profile – Shelter Section Incorrectly Displayed

On a pet’s profile, the shelter section does not show the shelter’s logo. Instead, it displays the pet’s photo, and the shelter’s location is missing from the card, it shows N/A.

Expected Behavior:
The shelter section should display the correct shelter logo and include the shelter’s location on the card.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

14. Take Me Home Page – Required Fields Not Enforced

On the Take Me Home page, required fields in forms are not functioning correctly - all fields are treated as optional.

Expected Behavior:
Required fields should be properly enforced, preventing form submission until they are filled out.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

15. Explore Page – Filtering Function Issues

The filtering functionality on the Explore page has multiple problems:

	Breed filter does not work.

	Pet type filter does not work (in the Lithuanian version).

	Location filtering by distance was removed; currently, exact addresses create too many irrelevant results.

	Age filter is not grouped correctly.

Expected Behavior:

	Breed and pet type filters should work correctly.

	Location filtering should use cities, not exact addresses; the dashboard should allow entering city and address separately.

	Filtering by distance should be available (e.g., 10 km, 50 km, 100 km, 150 km). (Here system should use exact adress)

	Age filter should have groups: up to 2 years, 2–7 years, over 7 years.

	After filtering, the page should visually match the standard Explore page layout, with the search bar, filter icon, and bottom bar intact, preserving a consistent UI.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16. Favorites – Filter Function Should Work Like Search

Currently, clicking the favorites icon shows results that do not match the current explore page frontend and may navigate away from the current view.

Expected Behavior:
If possible clicking the favorites icon should filter only liked pets in the same view, just like using the search bar. The UI (search bar, filter icon, bottom bar) should remain intact, and only the pets marked as favorites should be displayed without navigating away or showing unrelated pets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

17. My Pet Page – Chip Number Field Validation

On the My Pet page, the chip number field currently enforces a 10-digit requirement.

Expected Behavior:
The chip number field should not enforce a 10-digit requirement; users should be able to enter chip numbers of varying lengths or leave it optional.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18. My Pets – No Option to Delete Pet Profile

On the My Pets page, there is currently no way to delete a pet’s profile.

Expected Behavior:
Users should be able to delete a pet profile directly from the My Pets page.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

19. Services – Location Filtering Should Be Specific by Service Type

Currently, location filtering for services pulls cities from all service types together, showing a combined filter result for everyone.

Expected Behavior:
Each service type should have its own city list:

Stores: only cities where stores are located

Veterinary: only cities where vet services are available

Training, etc.: only their relevant cities
Filtering should display results specific to the selected service type, not a combined list.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20. Services – Search Bar and Dashboard Keywords

If possible it would be very useful to have a search bar in the services list. In the dashboard, each service should have a field to enter keywords. These keywords would not be visible in the app but would be used by the search bar.

Expected Behavior:

Services list has a search bar in the app.

Dashboard allows adding keywords per service (hidden in the app).

Search bar filters services based on name, description, and dashboard keywords.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

21. Pet Profile – Chip Number Visibility

The pet’s exact chip number is still displayed in the profile. This information should remain only in the dashboard.

Expected Behavior:
In the app, the pet profile should show only one of the following statuses instead of the actual chip number:

	- Chipped

	- Not chipped

	- N/A

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

22. Dashboard Notifications – Still Shared Across All Users

Current issue:
Notifications in the dashboard are still global, meaning all shelters and the admin panel see the same notifications. This creates confusion, as shelters receive messages unrelated to their own organization, and admins get a mixed feed from multiple shelters.

Expected behavior:
Each shelter should have its own isolated notification system, showing only updates relevant to that specific shelter (e.g., new adoption requests, changes in their listed animals, or internal messages).
The admin dashboard should have a separate notification channel, displaying only platform-wide or administrative updates, without interference from shelter-level notifications.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

23. Admin Dashboard – Blocking and Deleting Google-Authenticated Users

Current issue:
It seems that users who registered or logged in using Google authentication cannot be blocked from the admin dashboard. This limitation makes it difficult to manage inappropriate or fake accounts.

Expected behavior:
Admins should be able to:

Block users regardless of their login method (including Google sign-in).

Permanently delete user profiles when necessary (e.g., upon request or due to policy violations).

This functionality is essential for maintaining platform security, compliance, and overall account management integrity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

24. Password Recovery – Still Using Test Email Address

Current issue:
When requesting a password reset, the recovery email appears to still be sent from the testing email address rather than the official Amipeta email. This creates confusion for users and looks unprofessional.

Expected behavior:
Password recovery emails should be sent from the official Amipeta domain email address, with proper branding, subject line, and sender name. This helps maintain user trust and ensures consistency across all communications.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

25. Admin Dashboard – Email Not Updated

Current issue:
The admin dashboard email is still not changed to my own address.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

26. Explore Page – Duplicate and Missing Pets

Problem:
On the Explore page, the number of displayed pets matches the total number of uploaded profiles, but some pets appear multiple times while others are missing entirely. The random ordering works correctly, as the pets change position after each page reload, but the duplication and omission issue remains.

Expected Behavior:
Each pet profile should appear only once, and all uploaded pets should be visible in the list. The random order feature should remain, but without repeating or skipping any pets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

27. Home Page “See All” → Explore Page – Duplicated / Inflated Stray Animals List

Problem:
When tapping See all under stray animals on the Home page, the app navigates to the Explore page but the stray list contains duplicated animals and shows a larger number of items than actually uploaded. Some stray profiles repeat multiple times and others may be missing.

Expected Behavior:
Tapping See all should open the Explore page filtered to stray animals and display each stray profile exactly once. The total shown should match the actual number of uploaded stray animals (no duplicates, no omissions). Random ordering may remain, but must not cause repeats or inflate the count.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

28. Google Login – Profile Picture Disappears After Each Login

Problem:
When logging in using Google, the user’s profile picture disappears after each new login session. The image needs to be re-uploaded manually every time, which causes inconvenience and inconsistency in user profiles.

Expected Behavior:
Once a user logs in with Google, their profile picture should remain saved and consistently displayed across all sessions, without needing to re-upload it after each login.
